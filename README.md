> * Group Name: (be creative!)
> * Group participants names: (alphabetically sorted by last name)
> * Project Title: (can be changed later)

## General Introduction

(States your motivation clearly: why is it important / interesting to solve this problem?)
(Add real-world examples, if any)
(Put the problem into a historical context, from what does it originate? Are there already some proposed solutions?)

## The Model

(Define dependent and independent variables you want to study. Say how you want to measure them.) (Why is your model a good abtraction of the problem you want to study?) (Are you capturing all the relevant aspects of the problem?)


## Fundamental Questions

(At the end of the project you want to find the answer to these questions)
(Formulate a few, clear questions. Articulate them in sub-questions, from the more general to the more specific. )


## Expected Results

(What are the answers to the above questions that you expect to find before starting your research?)


## References 

(Add the bibliographic references you intend to use)
(Explain possible extension to the above models)
(Code / Projects Reports of the previous year)


## Research Methods

(Cellular Automata, Agent-Based Model, Continuous Modeling...) (If you are not sure here: 1. Consult your colleagues, 2. ask the teachers, 3. remember that you can change it afterwards)


## Other

(mention datasets you are going to use)

## Implementation details
The log dump for the main matlab code should be in the following format.
`[1 0 1 0 1 1 0 ] % the network connectivity matrix. (Upper triangular matrix)`
`[              ]`
`[              ]`
`        Health, index of node, diseased or not(means exceeds resistance)`
`example - 0.5,       125,           0 `
The bove line would mean node 125 is 50% healthy`

Each time stape should be put in a new file. for example 1.txt, 2.txt and so on.
